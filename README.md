# FBLA Wind Turbine Project
### 2nd place in FBLA Website Design & Coding

This website was coded over several months, and many updates were made.
Due to the competition guidelines, this website could not be published online.
But after the competition, we were allowed to publish our websites online

Here is the link to the website: https://harshith-jayadeva.github.io/FBLA-Updated-Website/

The website has a clean design, with gentle colors and animations. There are subtle animations throughout the website that enhance the user experience. For example, the home page has an animation that increases and decreases in size.  The statistics about our company have a unique animation; the numbers use a counter animation to increment up to the correct number. 

The main concept of this webpage was to create a job application page that allows users to apply for jobs. Some of the judges mentioned that our job application page was well-designed, looked great, and was simple for the average user. They did suggest some minor fixes as our job application page contained some minor issues.
